This project involves an artificial intelligence model developed to predict the creditworthiness levels of bank customers. Nowadays, banks typically make credit decisions based on customers' financial histories and demographic information. However, this process can sometimes result in manual evaluations and errors. Therefore, the project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of credit evaluation processes by leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques.
The goal of the project is to analyze the financial situations and histories of bank customers to predict their creditworthiness.
